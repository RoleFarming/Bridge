yarn install
yarn chain
```

> üõ∞ deploy your contract:

```bash
cd Draw-Bridge
yarn deploy
```

> configure variables

```javascript
const Supervisor = "<supervisor> // supervisor casper address for manage transfers
const CHAIN_NAME = "casper-test" // cspr chain name
const contractRFBTC = "<contract_address>" // eth contract address for rfbtc
const NODE_ADDRESS="http://138.201.54.44:7777/rpc" // cspr node address
const EVENT_STREAM_ADDRESS="http://138.201.54.44:9999/events/main" // cspr event stream
const RFBTC_CONTRACT_HASH = '<contract_address>' // eth contract address for rfbtc
```

> start your üì± frontend:

```bash
cd Draw-Bridge
yarn start
```

üåç You need an RPC key for production deployments/Apps, create an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and replace the value of `ALCHEMY_KEY = xxx` in `packages/react-app/src/constants.js`

üì± Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

## Testing algo
```
1. Connect Metamask
2. Connect Casper Signer
3. Grab ETH Faucet (for testent)
4. Grab CSPR Faucet (for testent) 
5. Enter amount
6. Push Exchane
7. If you are Supervisor:
7.1 enter CSPR privkey for order processing
7.2 Verify tx and push Approve
7.3 Push Cancel if not sure and back ETH manually
```

## Testing step by step

### Prepare

1. Disable CORS check in Chrome for testing 

DrawBridge is server less Web3 dApp and CORS should be configured by cloud housting like Vercel.app 
To avoid CORS error please install Chrome Extension 'Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin8' and then Toggle On it (or other extension if this not works, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3102819/disable-same-origin-policy-in-chrome)

### Terms

1. Supervisor

Supervisor is ETH administration account who can approve exchange operation ETH to Casper

2. User

User is client who want to produce exhange operation


### Testing sequence

0. You are need two browser User and Supervisor

User will request exchange ETH to CSPR and Supervisor can approve or denied operation

- Supervisor Browser
- User Browser
- Testnet CSPR (here is deployed contract). Get faucet with testnet.cspr.live
- Localhost ETH and Metamask network with ChainId 31337

1. Supervisor setup

1.1 Open Supervisor browser with Metamask and Casper Wallet

1.2 Login to Metamask

1.3 Select Metamask localhost because you deployed contract locally with yarn chain

1.4 Copy Metamask ETH account address

This address named SUPERVISOR

1.5 Edit constants.js

File:
```
packages/react-app/src/constants.js
```
Set variable SUPERVISOR to your Supervisor Metamask account address
```
export const SUPERVISOR = "0x3314b13a30747398d4c62FD1cadF152dB68D9bF4";
```

2. Contract setup

2.1 Deploy contract locally (if you are not did that already)
```
yarn deploy
```
The result of operation should be contract address.
```
$ yarn deploy
yarn run v1.22.17
$ yarn workspace @scaffold-eth/hardhat deploy
$ hardhat deploy --export-all ../react-app/src/contracts/hardhat_contracts.json
Compiling 2 files with 0.8.4

```
Contract should be connect automaticly for localhost with yarn start.

3. Run app
```
yarn start
